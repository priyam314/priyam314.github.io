      <description>Ever felt why we even need Variational AutoEncoders when simple AutoEncoders worked greatly?
And what the heck is this Variational Inference anyway?
Leave why or what, whats&amp;rsquo; going on with its&amp;rsquo; mathematics, too hard to grab any intutive understanding!!
I dealt with these problems for long, and maybe others&amp;rsquo; did too.
Dont&amp;rsquo; worry, Variational Inference: The Path üõ£Ô∏è Forward is here for rescue.
I have tried to keep things as streamlined as possible, such that readers don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about connecting broken links among concepts.</description>
